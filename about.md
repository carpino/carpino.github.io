I am **Pietro**, I have been working as a backend software developer since September 2021, mainly in Java and Go.
I have a BSc in computer science from the University of Padova and an Msc in computer science from the University of Pisa. My main interests are distributed systems and formal methods to verify them. In my free time it happened to me to do some model checking with TLA+ and the TLC model checker.
